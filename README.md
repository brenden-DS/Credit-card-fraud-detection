# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection repository! This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Below are the variables present in the dataset:

1. **CustomerID**
2. **A1, V2, ... A14**: These are the principal components obtained with PCA, which have been anonymized to protect sensitive information.
3. **Class**: The target variable, where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a legitimate transaction.

Feel free to explore the dataset and contribute to the development of more robust fraud detection models, & as always HAPPY ANALYZING!
